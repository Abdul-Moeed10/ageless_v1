# About
AGELESS is a Final Year Project created by [Abdul Moeed Siddiqui](https://github.com/Abdul-Moeed10) and [Aisha Faheem](https://github.com/AishaFaheem). 

The application was created as an all-in-one health app that places great focus on the elderly and terminally ill.

The application uses machine learning to predict user activity and fall events. In the event of a prolonged period of inactivity or if a fall occurs, the app has the capability to alert emergency services and/or contacts. It provides various other features as well, such as pill reminders, to-do lists, and sending current location.

The project was one of the winners of the FYP module at Zab-e-Fest 2023 and earned a 4.0 GPA.
